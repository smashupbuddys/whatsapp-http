## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system
- Node.js 16+ (for development)

### Quick Start

1. **Run with Docker** (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name whatshttp \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     -v whatsapp-sessions:/app/data \
     crazynds/whatshttp:latest
   ```

2. **Access the API documentation**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/docs`

## 📚 Documentation

### API Reference

Detailed API documentation is available at `/docs` when the server is running. The documentation includes:

- Available endpoints
- Request/response schemas
- Example requests
- Authentication requirements

### Webhook Payload Format

When a webhook URL is configured, the server will send HTTP POST requests with the following JSON structure for each event:

#### Message Received
```json
{
  "object": "whatsapp_web_account",
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": $clientId,
      "changes": [
        {
          "value": {
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
            "metadata": {
              "display_phone_number": $whatsappWebName,
              "phone_number_id": $clientId
            },
            "messages": [
              {
                "from": $senderPhoneNumber,
                "id": $messageId,
                "timestamp": $timestamp,
                "type": "text",
                "text": {
                  "body": $message_content,
                }
              },
              ...
            ]
            "statuses": [
              {
                "id": $messageId,
                "status": "sent|delivered|read|error",
                "timestamp": $timestamp,
                "recipient_id": $recipientPhoneNumber
              },
              ...
            ]
          },
          "field": "messages"
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Whatsapp Web Disconnected

```json
{
  "object": "whatsapp_web_account",
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": $clientId,
      "changes": [
        {
          "value": {
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
            "metadata": {
              "display_phone_number": $whatsappWebName,
              "phone_number_id": $clientId
            },
          },
          "field": "whatsapp_web_disconected"
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

If you are familiar with the Meta API, you will notice that the payload is very similar, but with some differences like the `object` field contains the value `whatsapp_web_account` instead of `whatsapp_business_account` and the disconected event has not an equivalent in the Meta API.

We will try to maintain compatibility with the Meta API in the future updates so you don't have to worry about.

#### Status Values
- `sent`: Message was sent by the server.
- `delivered`: Message was delivered to the recipient's device.
- `read`: Message was read by the recipient.
- `error`: There was an error when sending the message.


### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the server will listen on |
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/db.sqlite` | Path to SQLite database file (use `:memory:` for in-memory) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `http` | Logging level (error, warn, info, http, debug) |

### Volumes
